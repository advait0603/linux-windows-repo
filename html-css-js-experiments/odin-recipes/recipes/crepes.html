    <p>Crêpes are very thin pancakes. 
        They can be served with a wide variety of sweet and savory fillings and toppings. 
        The breakfast staple dates back to at least 13th-century France.</p>
    
    <p>Here are some ingredients required to make some basic, yet delicious crepes:-</p>

    <ul>

        <li><b>Flour: </b>These basic French crêpes start with a cup of all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs: </b>Eggs act as a binder, which means they help hold the batter together.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk: </strong>Milk adds moisture and keeps the crêpes tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Water: </strong>Water helps thin the batter</li>
        <li><strong>Salt: </strong>A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter: </strong>Butter lends richness and moisture to the crêpes.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Here's how you make some delicious crepes:-</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the flour and eggs.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the milk and water.</li>
        <li>Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle.</li>
        <li>Cook until lightly browned on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Flip and continue cooking until done on both sides.</li>
    </ol>
